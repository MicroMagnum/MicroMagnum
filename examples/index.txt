List of examples:
-----------------

System tests:
  sp0                   simple larmor precession test
  sp1                   muMAG standard problem #1 (hysteresis loop)
  sp2                   (does not work yet)
  sp3                   muMAG standard problem #3 (static energies)
  sp4                   muMAG standard problem #4 (dynamics) [0]
  sp5                   proposed spin torque problem [1]

Examples:
  flowerstate           create a flower state
  vortex                vortex excitation
  coupled-vortices      simulate two vortices coupled by stray field interaction
  domainwall            domain wall simulation

  demag_field           compute demag field from magnetization
  relax                 perform relaxation of a magnetization pattern

  imageshape            use an graphical image (png, ...) to define geometry
  omf2png               print omf file as png image

  macro-spintorque      (doesn't work) simulate macro spin torque

Not dependant on the magnum package:
  simplemag             demonstrates how the stray field is computed using fast convolutions. requires numpy.
  generator             HTML script that generates simple simulation scripts.

All examples in this directory are released into the public domain.

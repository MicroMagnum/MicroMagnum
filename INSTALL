Installation instructions are available at:

  http://micromagnum-tis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de

Basically, if all prerequisites are installed:

  cd src/build             # 1. enter build directory
  ./run-cmake.sh           # 2.       build setup
  #./run-cmake-cuda.sh     # build with 32-bit GPU support
  #./run-cmake-cuda-64.sh  #   -or- build setup with 64-bit GPU support (needs installed CUDA libraries and compiler and a GPU with device capability 2.0+)
  make                     # 3. compile everything
  sudo make install

How to check if everything went fine:

  cd examples/sp4
  ./sp4.py     # on CPU or use -g0 on GPU

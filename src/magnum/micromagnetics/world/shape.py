class Shape(object):
    """
    The abstract Shape class defines a geometrical shape in 3-D space.
    Shapes are used to define regions in the simulated volume in order
    to set up spatially varying material parameters (see World and Body
    classes).  The most important method is *isPointInside*, which has
    to be implemented by concrete subclasses.

    There are predefinded shapes to use and change.

    Complex shapes can be created from atomic shapes via set operations:
    union, intersect, invert.
    (see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry )

Fast Physical Simulator for Computations on CPU and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MicroMagnum is a fast easy-to-use simulator that runs on CPUs as well as on GPUs using the CUDA platform. It combines the speed and flexibility of C++ together with the usability of Python.

MicroMagnum has a robust and highly modular architecture. This enables its easy extension by further physical modules.

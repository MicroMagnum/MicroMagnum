MicroMagnum
===========

**Fast Physical Simulator for Computations on CPUs and Graphics Processing Units (GPU)**

MicroMagNum project homepage: http://micromagnum-tis.informatik.uni-hamburg.de

MicroMagnum is a fast easy-to-use simulator that runs on CPUs as well as on GPUs using the CUDA platform. It combines the speed and flexibility of C++ together with the usability of Python.

MicroMagnum has a robust and highly modular architecture. This enables its easy extension by further physical modules.

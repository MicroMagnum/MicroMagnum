Description: micromagnetic simulation
	MicroMagnum is a fast easy-to-use simulator that runs on CPUs as
	well as on GPUs using the CUDA platform. It combines the speed
	and flexibility of C++ together with the usability of Python.
	MicroMagnum has a robust and highly modular architecture. This
	enables its easy extension by further physical modules.
